To find out how much the Legos set cost, we need to subtract the earnings from the three little cars from the total earnings. We also need to know how much one little car costs, which is given as $5.
There are three little cars, so their total cost is 3 cars * $5 per car = $15.
The total amount earned was $45, so the cost of the Legos set is $45 - $15 = $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

To solve this, we need to calculate the carbon emissions before and after the introduction of the bus system. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial emissions:**
   - Population = 80
   - People driving by themselves = 80
   - Cars pollute 10 pounds of carbon per year.
   - Total emissions initially = 80 people * 10 pounds/year = 800 pounds/year

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total revenue from selling the woodburning. We can do this by multiplying the number of woodburning sold by the price per woodburning. Then, we subtract the cost of the wood from this total to find the profit. 

Revenue = Number of woodburning sold × Price per woodburning
Cost of the wood = $100

We know the number of woodburning sold is 20 and the price per woodburning is $15.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.
Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

First, we need to determine how many points Righty scores. Since Righty scores half as many points as Lefty, we calculate Righty's points by dividing Lefty's points by 2.
Next, we need to calculate their other teammate's points. Since their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty, we multiply Righty's points by 6.
Finally, we find the average points per player by adding all the points together and dividing by the number of players.

🤖 MODEL ANSWER: Speed = Distance / Time

First, convert the 45 minutes to hours:

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of beef sold over the three days.
On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.
Now, let's add up the total amount of beef sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.
To find the average daily sales, we divide the total amount by the number of days, which is 3 days.
So, we have 780 pounds / 3 days = 260 pounds per da...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First find the cost of the case: $1000 * 20% = $<<1000*20*.01=200>>200
Then find the cost of the headphones: $200 / 2 = $<<200/2=100>>100
Then find how much the phone contract will cost over a year: $200/month * 12 months/year = $<<200*12=2400>>2400
Finally, add the cost of the phone, accessories, and plan over the first year to find the total: $2400 + $100 + $200 + $1000 = $<<2400+100+200+1000=3700>>3700

📝 FULL MODEL OUTPUT:
<think>
Lisa buys a phone for $1000.
The phone contract costs $200/month.
The case costs 20% of the phone's price, so it is $1000 * 0.20 = $200.
The headphones cost half as much as the case, which is $200 / 2 = $100.
The total monthly cost is the phone contract and the cost of the case and the headphones: $200 + $200 + $100 = $500.
In a year, there are 12 months, so the total yearly cost is $500/month * 12 months = $6000.
