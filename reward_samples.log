To find out how much the Legos set cost, we need to subtract the earnings from the three little cars from the total earnings. We also need to know how much one little car costs, which is given as $5.
There are three little cars, so their total cost is 3 cars * $5 per car = $15.
The total amount earned was $45, so the cost of the Legos set is $45 - $15 = $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.
Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

First, we need to determine how many points Righty scores. Since Righty scores half as many points as Lefty, we calculate Righty's points by dividing Lefty's points by 2.
Next, we need to calculate their other teammate's points. Since their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty, we multiply Righty's points by 6.
Finally, we find the average points per player by adding all the points together and dividing by the number of players.

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of beef sold over the three days.
On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.
Now, let's add up the total amount of beef sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.
To find the average daily sales, we divide the total amount by the number of days, which is 3 days.
So, we have 780 pounds / 3 days = 260 pounds per da...

Lisa buys a phone for $1000.
The phone contract costs $200/month.
The case costs 20% of the phone's price, so it is $1000 * 0.20 = $200.
The headphones cost half as much as the case, which is $200 / 2 = $100.
The total monthly cost is the phone contract and the cost of the case and the headphones: $200 + $200 + $100 = $500.
In a year, there are 12 months, so the total yearly cost is $500/month * 12 months = $6000.

To determine the difference in carbon emissions before and after the introduction of the bus service, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the original carbon emissions**:
    - Original number of people who drove: 80
    - Total carbon emissions without the bus: 
        80 people * 10 pounds/carbon = 800 pounds

2. **Calculate the number of people now using the bus**:

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. John sells each woodburning for $15 and sells 20 of them. So the total revenue is 20 * $15 = $300. 

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the wood. John spent $100 to buy the wood. 

Now we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. So, profit = $300 - $100 = $200.

Therefore, the answer is $200.

So, we can write:
\[ \frac{T}{2} \text{ (raspberries)} + \frac{T}{3} \text{ (blackberries)} + \text{ (blueberries)} = T \]

Since the total number of berries is:
\[ T = 42 \]

<answer>
The total amount of beef sold over the three days is:
210 pounds (Thursday) + 2*(210 pounds) (Friday) + 150 pounds (Saturday) = 860 pounds

The number of days is 3.

So, the average amount of beef sold per day is:
860 pounds / 3 days = 286.67 pounds/day

First, let's find the cost of the case. The case costs 20% of the cost of the phone. So, the cost of the case is 0.2 * $1000 = $200.
Next, we find the cost of the headphones. The headphones cost half as much as the case. So, the cost of the headphones is $200 / 2 = $100.
Now, let's find the total monthly cost of the phone. This is the cost of the phone plus the cost of the case plus the cost of the headphones. So, the total monthly cost is $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300.

First, we need to find the total amount of money the company has taken in. This is the sum of the individual bookings and the group bookings.

$12,000 (individual bookings) + $16,000 (group bookings) = $28,000

Next, we need to account for the $1600 that was returned due to cancellations.

$28,000 - $1600 = $26,400

Therefore, the sky diving company has taken altogether $26,400.

First, we need to calculate Luis's speed. He drives 80 miles in 2 hours.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Now we need to calculate the distance he will cover in 15 minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
15 minutes = 15/60 = 1/4 hour
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 40 miles per hour x 1/4 hour = 10 miles.

First, calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. This is done by multiplying the number of woodburning sold by the price per piece:
20 * $15 = $300

Next, subtract the cost of the wood from the total revenue to find the profit. This is done by subtracting the cost of the wood from the total revenue:
$300 - $100 = $200

Therefore, the profit is $200.

Answer: $200

Let's solve this step by step.
Initially, there are 250 books in the library.
On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out, so we subtract 120 from 250.
250 - 120 = 130 books remaining in the library.
On Wednesday, 35 books are returned, so we add 35 to 130.
130 + 35 = 165 books in the library.
On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn, so we subtract 15 from 165.
165 - 15 = 150 books remaining in the library.

Each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \) as many jeans as Ali's closet, which can hold 200 pairs.

So, each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \times 200 = 50 \) pairs of jeans.

Since Noah has two closets, we multiply the number of jeans each closet can fit by 2.

\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) pairs of jeans can fit in both of Noah's closets.

Sam won 50% of the first 100 matches. 
We need to calculate 50% of 100, which is 50 matches.
In his next 100 games, he won 60% of the matches.
To find out how many matches he won, we need to calculate 60% of 100, which is 60 matches.
To find the total number of matches he won, we add the number of matches he won in the first 100 games and the number of matches he won in the next 100 games.
50 + 60 = 110 matches

Let's break down the problem step by step.
First, let's denote the amount Porter made from selling his previous painting as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount sold the most recent painting for is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.
2. He received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting.

We can express this relationship using the equation:
\[ x + 1000 = 5x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( J \). The total cost of the items is given as $110. We know that the coat costs $40 and the shoes cost $30. The cost of the two pairs of jeans is then \( 2J \). We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 40 + 30 + 2J = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2J = 110 \]

Now we solve for \( J \):
\[ 2J = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2J = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, one pair of jeans costs $20.

To solve this problem, we first find the average number of times Camden and Susannah swam each week.

Camden swam 16 times in March. Dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Susannah swam 24 times in March, so dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

This means Camden swam 4 times a week, and Susannah swam 6 times a week.

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we subtract Camden's number of swims from Susannah's:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James, so the total cost for the jeans is \( 2J \). She also bought a coat for James for $40 and a pair of shoes for Jamie for $30. The total cost of the items was $110. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2J + 40 + 30 = 110 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 2J + 70 = 110 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate \( 2J \):

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as B.
According to the information given, there were twice as many cardinals as bluebirds, so the number of cardinals would be 2B.
There were half as many swallows as bluebirds, so the number of swallows would be B/2.
It's also given that there were 2 swallows, which means B = 2.
Now we can find the number of birds for each type, given B = 2:
- Number of bluebirds: B = 2
- Number of cardinals: 2B = 2 * 2 = 4
- Number of swallows: B/2 = 2/2 = 1

On Friday they sold twice the amount they sold on Thursday, so 210 * 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday they sold 150 pounds.
Now we add up the total amount sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.

Let's solve this step by step.
1. First, find out how much Maya could lift when she started.
   America can lift 240 pounds.
   Maya can lift a fourth of that, so:
    Maya's initial lift = 240/4 = 60 pounds.
2. Now we know that Maya can lift 60 pounds when she starts.
3. Now, let's figure out how much Maya can lift at her peak. 
   Maya needs to lift half of what America can lift, which is 300 pounds.
4. Let's denote Maya's peak lift as \( M \).
   So, \( M = \frac{300}{2} \).

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the reduction in price first, and then find the total reduction from the original selling price.

1. Calculate the first reduction:
   - Original price: $500
   - Reduction: 5%
   - Reduction amount: $500 * (5/100) = $25
   
   Therefore, after the first reduction, the price is $500 - $25 = $475.

2. Calculate the second reduction:
   - New price after first reduction: $475
   - Reduction: 4%
   - Reduction amount: $475 * (4/100) = $19

Sam won 50% of his first 100 matches, which is 50% of 100. To calculate this, we use the formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the first 100 matches is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches, which is 60% of 100. To calculate this, we use the same formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the next 100 games is 100 * 0.6 = 60.

Step 1: Calculate the price reduction for the first week.
- The price reduction for the first week is 5% of the original price.
  Initial price: $500
  Reduction: 5% of $500
  $500 * 0.05 = $25

So, the price after the first week reduction is:
$500 - $25 = $475

Step 2: Calculate the price reduction for the second month.
- The price reduction for the second month is 4% of the new price after the first week's reduction.
  New price: $475
  Reduction: 4% of $475
  $475 * 0.04 = $19
