To find out how much the Legos set cost, we need to subtract the earnings from the three little cars from the total earnings. We also need to know how much one little car costs, which is given as $5.
There are three little cars, so their total cost is 3 cars * $5 per car = $15.
The total amount earned was $45, so the cost of the Legos set is $45 - $15 = $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.
Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

First, we need to determine how many points Righty scores. Since Righty scores half as many points as Lefty, we calculate Righty's points by dividing Lefty's points by 2.
Next, we need to calculate their other teammate's points. Since their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty, we multiply Righty's points by 6.
Finally, we find the average points per player by adding all the points together and dividing by the number of players.

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of beef sold over the three days.
On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.
Now, let's add up the total amount of beef sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.
To find the average daily sales, we divide the total amount by the number of days, which is 3 days.
So, we have 780 pounds / 3 days = 260 pounds per da...

Lisa buys a phone for $1000.
The phone contract costs $200/month.
The case costs 20% of the phone's price, so it is $1000 * 0.20 = $200.
The headphones cost half as much as the case, which is $200 / 2 = $100.
The total monthly cost is the phone contract and the cost of the case and the headphones: $200 + $200 + $100 = $500.
In a year, there are 12 months, so the total yearly cost is $500/month * 12 months = $6000.

To determine the difference in carbon emissions before and after the introduction of the bus service, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the original carbon emissions**:
    - Original number of people who drove: 80
    - Total carbon emissions without the bus: 
        80 people * 10 pounds/carbon = 800 pounds

2. **Calculate the number of people now using the bus**:

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. John sells each woodburning for $15 and sells 20 of them. So the total revenue is 20 * $15 = $300. 

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the wood. John spent $100 to buy the wood. 

Now we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. So, profit = $300 - $100 = $200.

Therefore, the answer is $200.

So, we can write:
\[ \frac{T}{2} \text{ (raspberries)} + \frac{T}{3} \text{ (blackberries)} + \text{ (blueberries)} = T \]

Since the total number of berries is:
\[ T = 42 \]

<answer>
The total amount of beef sold over the three days is:
210 pounds (Thursday) + 2*(210 pounds) (Friday) + 150 pounds (Saturday) = 860 pounds

The number of days is 3.

So, the average amount of beef sold per day is:
860 pounds / 3 days = 286.67 pounds/day

First, let's find the cost of the case. The case costs 20% of the cost of the phone. So, the cost of the case is 0.2 * $1000 = $200.
Next, we find the cost of the headphones. The headphones cost half as much as the case. So, the cost of the headphones is $200 / 2 = $100.
Now, let's find the total monthly cost of the phone. This is the cost of the phone plus the cost of the case plus the cost of the headphones. So, the total monthly cost is $1000 + $200 + $100 = $1300.

First, we need to find the total amount of money the company has taken in. This is the sum of the individual bookings and the group bookings.

$12,000 (individual bookings) + $16,000 (group bookings) = $28,000

Next, we need to account for the $1600 that was returned due to cancellations.

$28,000 - $1600 = $26,400

Therefore, the sky diving company has taken altogether $26,400.

First, we need to calculate Luis's speed. He drives 80 miles in 2 hours.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Now we need to calculate the distance he will cover in 15 minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
15 minutes = 15/60 = 1/4 hour
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 40 miles per hour x 1/4 hour = 10 miles.

First, calculate the total revenue from selling the woodburning. This is done by multiplying the number of woodburning sold by the price per piece:
20 * $15 = $300

Next, subtract the cost of the wood from the total revenue to find the profit. This is done by subtracting the cost of the wood from the total revenue:
$300 - $100 = $200

Therefore, the profit is $200.

Answer: $200

Let's solve this step by step.
Initially, there are 250 books in the library.
On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out, so we subtract 120 from 250.
250 - 120 = 130 books remaining in the library.
On Wednesday, 35 books are returned, so we add 35 to 130.
130 + 35 = 165 books in the library.
On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn, so we subtract 15 from 165.
165 - 15 = 150 books remaining in the library.

Each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \) as many jeans as Ali's closet, which can hold 200 pairs.

So, each of Noah's closets can fit \( \frac{1}{4} \times 200 = 50 \) pairs of jeans.

Since Noah has two closets, we multiply the number of jeans each closet can fit by 2.

\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) pairs of jeans can fit in both of Noah's closets.

Sam won 50% of the first 100 matches. 
We need to calculate 50% of 100, which is 50 matches.
In his next 100 games, he won 60% of the matches.
To find out how many matches he won, we need to calculate 60% of 100, which is 60 matches.
To find the total number of matches he won, we add the number of matches he won in the first 100 games and the number of matches he won in the next 100 games.
50 + 60 = 110 matches

Let's break down the problem step by step.
First, let's denote the amount Porter made from selling his previous painting as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount sold the most recent painting for is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.
2. He received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting.

We can express this relationship using the equation:
\[ x + 1000 = 5x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( J \). The total cost of the items is given as $110. We know that the coat costs $40 and the shoes cost $30. The cost of the two pairs of jeans is then \( 2J \). We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 40 + 30 + 2J = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2J = 110 \]

Now we solve for \( J \):
\[ 2J = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2J = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, one pair of jeans costs $20.

To solve this problem, we first find the average number of times Camden and Susannah swam each week.

Camden swam 16 times in March. Dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Susannah swam 24 times in March, so dividing this by 4 weeks, we have:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

This means Camden swam 4 times a week, and Susannah swam 6 times a week.

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we subtract Camden's number of swims from Susannah's:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James, so the total cost for the jeans is \( 2J \). She also bought a coat for James for $40 and a pair of shoes for Jamie for $30. The total cost of the items was $110. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2J + 40 + 30 = 110 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 2J + 70 = 110 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate \( 2J \):

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as B.
According to the information given, there were twice as many cardinals as bluebirds, so the number of cardinals would be 2B.
There were half as many swallows as bluebirds, so the number of swallows would be B/2.
It's also given that there were 2 swallows, which means B = 2.
Now we can find the number of birds for each type, given B = 2:
- Number of bluebirds: B = 2
- Number of cardinals: 2B = 2 * 2 = 4
- Number of swallows: B/2 = 2/2 = 1

On Friday they sold twice the amount they sold on Thursday, so 210 * 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday they sold 150 pounds.
Now we add up the total amount sold: 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.

Let's solve this step by step.
1. First, find out how much Maya could lift when she started.
   America can lift 240 pounds.
   Maya can lift a fourth of that, so:
    Maya's initial lift = 240/4 = 60 pounds.
2. Now we know that Maya can lift 60 pounds when she starts.
3. Now, let's figure out how much Maya can lift at her peak. 
   Maya needs to lift half of what America can lift, which is 300 pounds.
4. Let's denote Maya's peak lift as \( M \).
   So, \( M = \frac{300}{2} \).

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the reduction in price first, and then find the total reduction from the original selling price.

1. Calculate the first reduction:
   - Original price: $500
   - Reduction: 5%
   - Reduction amount: $500 * (5/100) = $25
   
   Therefore, after the first reduction, the price is $500 - $25 = $475.

2. Calculate the second reduction:
   - New price after first reduction: $475
   - Reduction: 4%
   - Reduction amount: $475 * (4/100) = $19

Sam won 50% of his first 100 matches, which is 50% of 100. To calculate this, we use the formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the first 100 matches is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches, which is 60% of 100. To calculate this, we use the same formula: number of matches won = total matches * percentage won. So, the number of matches won in the next 100 games is 100 * 0.6 = 60.

Step 1: Calculate the price reduction for the first week.
- The price reduction for the first week is 5% of the original price.
  Initial price: $500
  Reduction: 5% of $500
  $500 * 0.05 = $25

So, the price after the first week reduction is:
$500 - $25 = $475

Step 2: Calculate the price reduction for the second month.
- The price reduction for the second month is 4% of the new price after the first week's reduction.
  New price: $475
  Reduction: 4% of $475

So, we can write the equation:
2x + $40 + $30 = $110
Now, we can solve for x:
2x + $70 = $110

We will start by calculating the total number of boxes.
Group 1: 7 trucks with 20 boxes each, for 7*20 = 140 boxes.
Group 2: 5 trucks with 12 boxes each, for 5*12 = 60 boxes.
Total: 140 boxes + 60 boxes = 200 boxes.
Each box contains 8 containers of oil, so total oil: 200 boxes * 8 containers = 1600 containers.
We'll redistribute the oil onto 10 trucks, so each truck will have 1600 containers / 10 trucks = 160 containers of oil.

Let's calculate the distance each runner covers in 56 minutes.
For the first runner:
56 minutes / 8 minutes per mile = 7 miles

For the second runner:
56 minutes / 7 minutes per mile = 8 miles

After 56 minutes, the second runner has covered 8 miles and has stopped. The first runner can continue for a certain time before catching up with the second runner.

When the first runner starts, the second runner has already covered 8 miles, so the gap between them is 8 miles. The first runner runs...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 miles.
Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 miles.
Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = <<8-7=1>>1 mile apart when the second runner stops.
Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile.

First, we need to determine how far the second runner has run in 56 minutes. Since he runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile, we can set up an equation to find the distance he has covered.

The equation is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 7 \, \text{minutes/mile} \times 56 \, \text{minutes} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 392 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the second runner has covered 392 miles in 56 minutes.

Now, to find out how much Denver will charge for two birdhouses, we multiply the cost of one birdhouse by 2: $16 * 2 = $32.

Therefore, Denver will charge Danny $32 for buy...

The equation can be set up as:
\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

One pair of jeans costs $20.

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as \(B\).
According to the problem, swallows (\(S\)) are half as many as bluebirds, so \(S = \frac{1}{2}B\).
Also, there are three times more cardinals (\(C\)) than bluebirds, so \(C = 3B\).

Given that swallows \(S\) are 2, we can write:
\[ S = 2 \]

Substituting this into our equation for swallows, we get:
\[ 2 = \frac{1}{2}B \]

Solving for \(B\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ B \cdot 2 = 2 \]
\[ B = 1 \]

To find the combined total number of sit-ups performed, we need to calculate the number of sit-ups each person does separately and then add them up.

1. Barney: He can do 45 sit-ups per minute. In 1 minute, he will do 45 sit-ups.
2. Carrie: She can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney, so she can do 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups per minute. In 2 minutes, she will do 90 * 2 = 180 sit-ups.
3. Jerrie: She can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, so she can do 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per min...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: Carrie can do 2*45=<<2*45=90>>90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 90+5=<<90+5=95>>95 sit-ups per minute.
In two minutes, Carrie would perform 90*2-180 sit-ups.
And in three minutes, Jerrie would perform 3 * 95=<<3*95=285>>285 sit-ups.
Thus, in the scenario described, in total, the three would perform 45+180+285=<<45+180+285=510>>510 sit-ups.

In order to calculate how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, I need to find his speed first. The speed can be calculated as: speed = distance / time
Luis drove 80 miles in 2 hours, so his speed is: 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.
15 minutes is therefore 15/60 of an hour.
So in 15 minutes, Luis will drive: 40 miles per hour * 15/60 = 10 miles.

To solve this, we need to find Luis's speed in miles per hour, and then use that to find out how far he travels in 15 minutes.
Speed = distance/time
80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour
Now, we use the speed to find out how far Luis travels in 15 minutes:
15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 1/4 hours
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 40 miles per hour * 1/4 hours = 10 miles
Therefore, Luis will travel 10 miles in 15 minutes.

According to the problem, the sale price of the most recent painting is \( 5x - 1000 \).
We are given that the sale price is $44,000. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5x - 1000 = 44000 \]
To find \( x \), we first add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 5x = 45000 \]
Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 9000 \]
So, Porter made $9,000 for selling his previous painting.

Let's break down the information given:
1. The most recent painting sold for $44,000.
2. This amount is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.

Let's denote the amount made from the previous painting as \( P \).

From the second piece of information, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 44000 = 5P - 1000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \).
</think>

To solve for \( P \), we first add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 44000 + 1000 = 5P \]

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

The original price of the bag is $500.
A week after, the price was reduced by 5%.
Let's calculate the reduced price to find out how much the bag cost before the second reduction.

$500 - (5% of $500) = $500 - ($500 * 0.05) = $500 - $25 =$475.

Now, a month after, the price was reduced by another 4%.

$475 - (4% of $475) = $475 - ($475 * 0.04) = $475 - $19 = $456.

So, the final selling price after the second reduction is $456.

Let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. The original selling price is $500.
2. After a week, the price was reduced by 5%, so we calculate 5% of $500.
   5% of $500 = 0.05 * $500 = $25
3. Therefore, the new price after the first reduction is:
   $500 - $25 = $475
4. A month later, the bag was sold at $475. The price was reduced by 4% from this selling price.
5. Calculate 4% of $475.
   4% of $475 = 0.04 * $475 = $19

8 ounces x 4 = 32 ounces
5 ounces x 6 = 30 ounces
Total used = 32 + 30 = 62 ounces
122 ounces - 62 ounces = 60 ounces
Finally, we need to calculate how many 4-ounce glasses Claudia can fill.

<answer>
40 mph
</answer>

Now, we need to calculate how far Luis will travel in 15 minutes at his average speed of 40 mph. 

1. We know that 15 minutes is equal to 0.25 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 0.25 hours = 15 minutes).
2. Now, we multiply the distance he travels in 1 hour (80 miles) by the ratio of hours in 15 minutes to 1 hour:
   80 miles/1 hour * 0....

Denver wants to make a $5.50 profit per birdhouse. To find out how much he will charge for each birdhouse, we add his cost to his profit: $10.50 + $5.50 = $16.00.
Now, if Danny wants to buy two birdhouses, Denver will charge Danny: 2 * $16.00 = $32.00.

Therefore, Denver will charge Danny $32.00 for two birdhouses.

First, we need to figure out the total number of donuts Sophie bought. Since there are 12 donuts in each box and she bought 4 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of donuts per box.
Total donuts bought = 12 donuts/box * 4 boxes = 48 donuts

Next, we need to determine how many donuts Sophie gave away. She gave away 1 box of donuts which is 12 donuts, and half a dozen donuts. Since half a dozen is 6 donuts, the total donuts given away = 12 + 6 = 18 donuts.

Let's start by identifying the information given:
- There are 2 swallows.
- The number of swallows is half the number of bluebirds.
- The number of cardinals is three times the number of bluebirds.

First, we can determine the number of bluebirds:
Since swallows are half the number of bluebirds:
\[ \text{Number of bluebirds} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, we find the number of cardinals:
\[ \text{Number of cardinals} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Now, we add up all the birds to get the total number ...

First, let's find out how many sit-ups each person can do per minute.
Barney can do 45 sit-ups per minute.
Carrie can do twice as many as Barney, which is 45 * 2 = 90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, which is 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per minute.
Now let's calculate the total number of sit-ups each person does.
Barney performs sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does 45 sit-ups.

To find out how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, we first need to determine his speed in miles per hour. We can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.
Now, since 15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour, we can calculate the distance he will travel in that time.
Distance = speed * time = 40 miles/hour * 15/60 hours = 10 miles.

First, let's calculate the revenue from last month's sales.
For large paintings: 8 large paintings * $60 per painting = $480
For small paintings: 4 small paintings * $30 per painting = $120
Total revenue for last month = $480 + $120 = $600

Now, let's calculate the number of paintings sold this month.
Twice as much as last month: 2 * 8 large paintings + 2 * 4 small paintings = 16 large paintings + 8 small paintings = 24 paintings

Let's break down the information given:
1. The sale price of the most recent painting was $44,000.
2. The sale price was $1000 less than five times more than what he made on his previous painting.

Let \( x \) be the amount he made on his previous painting.
The equation based on the information is:
\[ 44,000 = 5x - 1000 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 44,000 + 1000 = 5x \]
\[ 45,000 = 5x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x...

The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.

First we need to find out how much money James has after saving for four weeks. We do this by multiplying $10 by 4, because he earns $10 per week and saves it up for four weeks.
$10 x 4 = $40
Now we need to determine how much money James spends on the video game. We do this by finding half of his total savings. We do this by dividing $40 by 2.
$40 / 2 = $20
Now we know James has $20 remaining after buying the video game. We then need to find out how much money he spends on the book. We do ...

First, we calculate the total number of boxes in the 7 trucks with 20 boxes each and the 5 trucks with 12 boxes each.
Total boxes = (7 trucks * 20 boxes/truck) + (5 trucks * 12 boxes/truck)
Then, we find out how many containers of oil are there in total.
Total containers = Total boxes * 8 containers/box
Finally, we distribute all the oil onto 10 trucks.
Number of containers per truck = Total containers / 10 trucks

As Maya grows stronger, she adds 10 pounds each time she reaches her peak:

America reaches her peak at 300 pounds.

If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, she can:

So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

   $500 * 0.05 = $25 for the first reduction.
2. Subtract the first reduction from the original price: $500 - $25 = $475.
3. Calculate the second reduction from the new price:
   $475 * 0.04 = $19.
4. Subtract the second reduction from the new price to get the final selling price: $475 - $19 = $456.

   100 matches * 50% = 100 * 0.5 = 50 matches won

2. Next, we calculate the number of matches Sam won in his next 100 games. Since he won 60% of these matches:

First, we need to calculate the cost of the case and the headphones.
The case costs 20% of the phone's cost.
$200/month * .20 = $40/month for the case.
The headphones cost half as much as the case.
$40/month * .50 = $20/month for the headphones.
Now we need to add up all of the monthly costs.
$200/month + $40/month + $20/month = $260/month.
To find the total cost of the phone in the first year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12.
$260/month * 12 months = $3,120.

Let's denote the price of one pair of jeans as \( J \).

Mary bought her son James a coat for $40 and two pairs of jeans. So, the cost for the jeans is \( 2J \).

She also bought her sister Jamie a pair of shoes for $30.

The total cost of all the items amounted to $110. Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Now, we solve the equation to find the price of one pair of jeans.

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( J \).

Mary bought two pairs of jeans for her son James and one pair of shoes for his sister Jamie, with a total of $110.

The cost equation can be set up as follows:
\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 70 + 2J = 110 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides to isolate \( 2J \):
\[ 2J = 40 \]

Now, divide by 2 to solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 20 \]

So, one pair of jeans cost $20.

Next, find out how much meat James has in total by adding up the beef and pork he bought. That's 20 pounds (beef) + 10 pounds (pork) = 30 pounds.
Then, determine how many meals he can make by dividing the total pounds of meat by the pounds per meal. That's 30 pounds / 1.5 pounds per meal = 20 meals.

To find out how far Luis will go in 15 minutes, we first need to calculate his speed. We know that he drives 80 miles in 2 hours.

Speed is calculated with the formula: speed = distance / time

speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour

Now that we know his speed is 40 miles per hour, we can calculate how far he will go in 15 minutes.

15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour.

The stand sells 10 hot dogs per hour.
Each hot dog sells for $2.
Total sales per hour is 10 hot dogs * $2 per hot dog = $20.
We want to make $200 in sales.
To find out how many hours are needed, we divide the total sales by the sales per hour: $200 / $20 per hour = 10 hours.

Let's start by calculating the revenue generated per hour from selling hot dogs.
Revenue per hour = Hot dogs sold per hour * Price per hot dog
                 = 10 * $2
                 = $20

Now, we need to determine the number of hours required to reach the target sales of $200.
Hours required = Target sales / Revenue per hour
              = $200 / $20
              = 10

Therefore, the hot dog stand requires to run for 10 hours to make $200 in sales.

Next, we need to find out how much profit John makes. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of the wood from the total revenue. Profit = Total revenue - Cost of wood = $300 - $100 = $200.

Now, let's write the final answer.

To find the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of a kilogram of chicken and then calculate the total cost for 3 kilograms of chicken and 1 kilogram of pork.
Chicken costs $2 less than pork, so a kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $4.

Next, we calculate the cost for 3 kilograms of chicken: 3 kg × $4/kg = $12.

Then, we add the cost of 1 kilogram of pork: $12 + $6 = $18.

Therefore, a 3-kilogram of chicken and a kilogram of pork will cost $18.

\[ 40 + 2J + 30 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \).

\[ 2J = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{40}{2} \]

First, let's calculate how many jeans each of Noah's closets can fit.
Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans.
Each of Noah's closets can fit 1/4 of that, which is 200/4.
So, each of Noah's closets can fit 50 pairs of jeans.

Now that we know each of Noah's closets can fit 50 pairs of jeans, let's calculate how many pairs of jeans both closets can fit.
There are two closets, and each can fit 50 pairs, so we need to multiply 50 by 2.
50 x 2 = 100 pairs of jeans.

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, we first need to calculate the total amount sold over the three days.

On Thursday, Walmart sold 210 pounds of ground beef.
On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 210 x 2 = 420 pounds.
On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount sold over the three days:
210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount by the number of days to find the average:
780 ÷ 3 = 260 pounds per day

Luis drives 80 miles in 2 hours, so his rate is 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles/hour.

Next, we need to find out how far he travels in 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes is 15/60 = 1/4 of an hour.

Now we can calculate the distance Luis travels in 15 minutes. Distance = rate × time = 40 miles/hour × 1/4 hour = 10 miles.

Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 mph

Now, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours because Luis's speed is given in miles per hour.
15 minutes = 15/60 hours = 0.25 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Luis will travel in 15 minutes.
Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 40 mph * 0.25 hours = 10 miles

First, we need to calculate Noah's sales last month. He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings. The price for a large painting is $60 and for a small painting is $30.

1. Calculate the total revenue from large paintings:
8 large paintings * $60/large painting = $480

2. Calculate the total revenue from small paintings:
4 small paintings * $30/small painting = $120

3. Sum up the total revenue for last month:
$480 (from large paintings) + $120 (from small paintings) = $600

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as \( P \).

We know that the most recent painting sold for $44,000, which is $1000 less than five times more than he made on his previous painting. This can be mathematically represented as:

\[ \text{Price of most recent painting} = 5P - 1000 \]

Given that the price of the most recent painting is $44,000, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 44000 = 5P - 1000 \]

To solve for \( P \), we first add 1000 to both sides o...

Kenny charges $15 per lawn and has mowed 35 lawns, so his total income is $15 * 35 = $525.
The video-games cost $45 each, so he can buy 5 video-games for $45 * 5 = $225.
Now he has $525 - $225 = $300 left to spend on books.
Books cost $5 each, so he can buy 300 / 5 = 60 books.

$12,000 + $16,000 = $28,000
Next, subtract the amount that has to be returned: 
$28,000 - $1,600 = $26,400
Therefore, the sky diving company has taken altogether $26,400.
Answer: $26,400

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( x \).

Mary bought:
- A coat for $40.
- Two pairs of jeans for \( 2x \).
- A pair of shoes for $30.

The total cost was $110. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]

now, solve for \( x \)
\[ 40 + 30 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Therefore, one pair of jeans costs $20.

First, calculate the amount of pork James buys. He buys half as much pork as beef, so it's 10 pounds (half of 20 pounds).

Now add the beef and pork to find the total amount of meat he has: 20 pounds (beef) + 10 pounds (pork) = 30 pounds of meat.

Next, find how many meals he can make with the total amount of meat: 30 pounds / 1.5 pounds per meal = 20 meals.

Finally, calculate how much money he makes by multiplying the number of meals by the price per meal: 20 meals * $20 per meal = $40...

We can use the formula: distance = speed * time.

Speed can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.

First, we should find the speed.
Speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.

Now, to find the distance Luis travels in 15 minutes, we use his speed.
We need to convert the time into hours and then use it in the formula.
15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Distance = speed * time
          = 40 miles/hour * 0.25 hours

To find out how much Denver will charge for two birdhouses, we add his profit to the total cost: $21.00 + $5.50 = $26.50.

To find the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of a kilogram of chicken and then add that to the cost of the pork.
A kilogram of chicken costs $2 less than a kilogram of pork, so it costs $6 - $2 = $4.
Now that we know the cost of a kilogram of chicken, we can calculate the total cost for three kilograms of chicken: 3 * $4 = $12.
We already know the cost of a kilogram of pork, so we just need to add that to the cost of the chicken: $12 + $6 = $18.
Therefore, the total cost is ...

To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of a kilogram of chicken. This is given as $2 less than the kilogram of pork which costs $6.

1 kilogram of poultry = $6
1 kilogram of poultry - $2 = $4

1 kilogram of chicken costs $4.

Next, we calculate the cost for 3 kilograms of chicken:

3 kilograms of poultry = 3 × $4 = $12

Now, we add up the cost of pork and chicken:

Cost of pork = $6
Cost of chicken = $12

First, let's find out how much ground beef was sold on Friday. 
On Friday, they sold twice the amount of Thursday, so:
2 * 210 = 420 pounds
Now we have the total amount of ground beef sold on Thursday and Friday: 
210 + 420 = 630 pounds

Next, add Saturday to the total:
630 + 150 = 780 pounds

To find the average amount of beef sold per day, divide the total by the number of days: 
780 / 3 = 260 pounds per day

To find out the sales for this month, we first need to calculate the total sales for last month.
Last month, Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings.
For the large paintings, the total income would be: $60 x 8
For the small paintings, the total income would be: $30 x 4
Now, let's calculate the total sales for last month.
total sales for last month = $60 x 8 + $30 x 4
total sales for last month = $480 + $120
total sales for last month = $600
Now, to calculate the sales for this ...

Sam's first 100 matches, he won 50% of matches.
In his second 100 matches, he won 60% of matches. This means he won 60/100 * 100 = 60 matches.
His total wins is the sum of wins from the first 100 matches and 60 matches from the second 100 matches.
Total matches = 100 + 100 = 200.
We can find the total wins by using the following formula:
Total wins = (Number of matches * Percentage won) + (Number of matches * Percentage won)

Let's denote the amount Porter made on his previous painting as \( P \).
According to the problem, the sale price of his most recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.
This can be written as:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 5 \times P - 1000 \]
We know that the sale price is $44,000. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 44000 = 5 \times P - 1000 \]
To find \( P \), we first add 1000 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 44000 + 1000 = 5 \times P \]

1. We know George sold 3 little cars for a total of $5 each.
2. The total earnings from the cars = 3 cars * $5/car = $15.
3. We also know the total earnings from all the toys sold = $45.
4. So, to find the earnings from the Legos set, we subtract the earnings from the cars from the total earnings: $45 - $15 = $30.
5. Therefore, the Legos set cost $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

Jett bought the cow for $600.
He spent $20 every day to buy food, which means he spent $20 * 40 = $800 on food for 40 days.
He also spent $500 on vaccinating and deworming the cow.
Now, let's calculate the total cost: cost of the cow + cost of food + cost of vaccination = $600 + $800 + $500 = $1900.
Jett sold the cow for $2500.
To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price: $2500 - $1900 = $600.

Therefore, the profit is $600.

The answer is 600.

\$45 / 3 hours = \$15 per hour.
Now, to find out how many hours Alani needs to work to earn \$75, we can set up a proportion:
\$15 per hour / x hours = \$75 / 1 hour.
To solve for x, we can cross multiply: 15 * 1 = 75 * x.
Then, divide both sides by 75 to get x alone: x = 15 / 75.
x = 0.2 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices both pizzas have.
- Small cheese pizza: 8 slices
- Large pepperoni pizza: 14 slices

Total slices = 8 (small) + 14 (large) = 22 slices

Next, let's find out how many slices are left after both have eaten 9 slices each.
- Total slices left = 22 - (9 + 9) = 22 - 18 = 4 slices

Now, we need to divide these remaining slices equally between Phil and Andre.
- Remaining slices per person = 4 ÷ 2 = 2 slices per person

2. America's lift increases by 10 pounds each time Maya grows stronger until she reaches her peak at 300 pounds.
3. Maya's lift increases by 10 pounds each time she becomes stronger. We need to find out how many times she grows before reaching the peak.

Let's first calculate the number of sit-ups each person can do in one minute.
Barney can do 45 sit-ups per minute.
Carrie can do twice as many as Barney, so \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \) sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, so \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) sit-ups per minute.
Now, let's calculate the total number of sit-ups each person can perform over the given time periods.
Barney does sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does \( 1 \times 45 = 45 \) sit-ups.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.

Thus, its height at the end of 2018 is 100 + 10 = <<100+10=110>>110 meters.
At the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10/100 = <<110*10/100=11>>11 meters more.
So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.
Therefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = <<121-100=21>>21 meters.

End of 2018: 100m * 1.10 = 110m

Now, the tree has grown from 2017 until the end of 2019. We need to calculate the growth from 2017 to 2019.

If the stand sells 10 hot dogs per hour, then the total sales for one hour are 10 hot dogs * $2 per hot dog = $20.

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total expenses and then subtract that from the selling price.

1. Calculate total expenses over 40 days:
   - Food cost: $20/day * 40 days = $800
   - Vaccination and deworming cost: $500
   - Total expenses: $800 + $500 = $1300

2. Subtract total expenses from the selling price:
   - Selling price: $2500
   - Total expenses: $1300
   - Profit: $2500 - $1300 = $1200

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The total cost of food that the cow ate for the forty days is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
To feed and maintain the health of the cow, the total expenses Jett used is $500+$800 = $<<500+800=1300>>1300
With the expenses, Jett used $1300+$600 = $<<1300+600=1900>>1900 on the cow.
If he sold the cow at $2500, Jett made a profit of $2500-$1900 = $<<2500-1900=600>>600

Jett bought the cow for $600.
He spent $20 every day for 40 days on buying food, which amounts to $20 * 40 = $800.
He also spent $500 on vaccinating and deworming the cow.
Now, we need to calculate the total expenses:
$600 (initial cost) + $800 (food) + $500 (vaccination and deworming) = $1900 total expenses.
Jett sold the cow for $2500.
To calculate the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the sale price:
$2500 (sale price) - $1900 (total expenses) = $600 profit.

According to the problem, Drew is currently 12 years old, so D = 12.

In five years, Drew's age will be D + 5 and Sam's age will be S + 5.

The problem states that in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew. So, we can write the equation:

S + 5 = 3 * (D + 5)

We know D = 12, so we can substitute that into the equation:

S + 5 = 3 * (12 + 5)

$45 ÷ 3 hours = $15 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $75. We can set up a proportion to solve this:
$45 / 3 hours = $75 / x hours

Cross multiply and solve for x:

x = 225 ÷ 45

To find the total cost, we need to follow these steps:
1. Determine the cost of a kilogram of chicken, which is $2 less than a kilogram of pork.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken.
3. Add the cost of 1 kilogram of pork.
4. Sum the costs to get the total.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of a kilogram of chicken.
Cost of pork = $6
Cost of chicken = Cost of pork - $2 = $6 - $2 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken.
Cost of 3 kilograms of chicken = 3 × $4 = $12

First, we need to determine how much Maya can lift before her peak. Since America can lift 300 pounds at her peak and Maya can lift half of that amount, Maya can lift 300 / 2 = 150 pounds before her peak.

Next, we need to consider the rate at which Maya improves. America adds 10 more pounds to what Maya can lift each time. Since America's peak is 300 pounds, Maya can lift 150 pounds at the beginning, but after a certain amount of time, her lifting ability increases by 10 pounds each time....

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.

J = 2 * Ce
And the total number of erasers collected is given by:
G + Ce + J = 35
Substituting the relationships between the quantities, we get:
G + 2 * G + 2 * 2 * G = 35
This simplifies to:
G + 2 * G + 4 * G = 35
Combining like terms, we have:
7 * G = 35
To find G, we divide both sides by 7:
G = 5
Now, using the relationship...

Let's denote the length of the red bus as R, the length of the orange car as C, and the length of the yellow bus as Y.
We know that R = 4 * C and C = 3.5 * Y.
R = 48 feet.
R = 4 * C => C = R / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12 feet.
C = 3.5 * Y => Y = C / 3.5 = 12 / 3.5 = 3.43 feet.
The yellow bus driver will see the length of the red bus minus the length of the yellow bus.

Let's start by defining the variables:
- Let \(R\) be the length of the red bus.
- Let \(O\) be the length of the orange car.
- Let \(Y\) be the length of the yellow bus.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. \(R = 4 \times O\)
2. \(O = \frac{1}{3.5} \times Y\)

We also know that \(R = 48\) feet. So we can substitute \(R\) with 48 in the first equation:
- \(48 = 4 \times O\)

Now, we solve for \(O\):
\[O = \frac{48}{4} = 12\]

Now we know the length of the orange car, we can determine...

Let's start by calculating the price reduction after the first week.
The original price is $500, and it is reduced by 5%.
To find the reduced price, we calculate:
$500 - (5% of $500) = $500 - ($500 * 0.05)
$500 - $25 = $475
Now, the price is reduced by 4% after a month.
The new selling price is $475, and it is reduced by 4%.
To find the final selling price, we calculate:
$475 - (4% of $475) = $475 - ($475 * 0.04)
$475 - $19 = $456
The total reduction in price is from the original price o...

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. America's peak lift is 300 pounds.
2. Maya starts by lifting a fourth of what America can lift. So, Maya's initial lift is:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 300 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

3. Maya can add 10 more pounds to her initial lift as she grows stronger. So, now her lift is:
   \[ 75 + 10 = 85 \text{ pounds} \]

4. Maya's peak lift (after reaching her absolute peak) is half of what America can lift. So, if America's peak lift is 300 pounds, Maya...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The original price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.
So its selling price after a week was $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.
The price of the bag was again reduced by $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.
So, its selling price now is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.
Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

Let's break it down step by step.
1. The original price of the bag is $500.
2. The price is reduced by 5% the first week. To find the price after this reduction, we calculate 5% of $500 and subtract it from $500.
   5% of $500 is calculated as:
   \( 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \)
   Subtracting this from the original price:

Lefty scores 20 points. Righty scores half as many, so Righty scores 20 / 2 = 10 points.
Righty's teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty does, so Righty's teammate scores 6 * 10 = 60 points.
The total points scored by the team is 20 + 10 + 60 = 90 points.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: First, we need to determine how many points Righty scored. To do this we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 points since Righty scored half as many as Lefty did.
Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

✓ GROUND TRUTH: At the end of 2018, the tree will grow 100 x 10/100 = <<100*10/100=10>>10 meters more.
Thus, its height at the end of 2018 is 100 + 10 = <<100+10=110>>110 meters.
At the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10/100 = <<110*10/100=11>>11 meters more.
So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.
Therefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = <<121-100=21>>21 meters.

At the end of 2017, the tree's height is 100 meters.
In 2018, it grows by 10%, so 100 * 0.10 = 10 meters.
At the end of 2018, the tree is 100 + 10 = 110 meters tall.

To determine how long the tree has grown from 2017 until the end of 2019, we need to calculate its height at the end of 2018 and 2019, and compare it to its height at the end of 2017.

First, let's calculate the height of the tree at the end of 2018. The tree grew by 10% from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018. Since the tree was 100 meters tall at the end of 2017, we calculate:

Let's break this down step by step.
- Kenny charges $15 per lawn.
- He mowed 35 lawns, so he earned 35 * 15 = $525.
- The price of one video-game is $45, so 5 video-games would cost 5 * 45 = $225.
- After buying the video-games, he has 525 - 225 = $300 remaining.
- The price of one book is $5, so with his remaining money, he can buy 300 / 5 = 60 books.

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as \( x \).

According to the problem, the amount Porter received from the most recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than what he made on his previous painting. This can be represented as:
\[ 44000 = 5x - 1000 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 5x - 1000 = 44000 \]
\[ 5x = 44000 + 1000 \]
\[ 5x = 45000 \]
\[ x = \frac{45000}{5} \]
\[ x = 9000 \]

Then, she gave 1 box to her mom. If each box contains 12 donuts, then 1 box * 12 donuts/box = 12 donuts.

To find the number of donuts that were left for Sophie, we subtract the numb...

A bus can hold 40 people, so it will not be fully utilized.
The number of cars not needed is 20 * 0.25 = 5 cars.
Each car pollutes 10 pounds of carbon a year, so 5 cars will not pollute 5 * 10 = 50 pounds of carbon a year.

First, let's calculate how many stickers she needs to give to each friend:

She has 100 space stickers and 50 cat stickers, which makes a total of 150 stickers to give equally among her 3 friends.
To divide 150 by 3, we have: 150 ÷ 3 = 50 stickers per friend.

Now subtract the total number of stickers given to her friends from the total number of stickers she has originally:
100 space stickers + 50 cat stickers = 150 stickers
150 stickers - 50 stickers = 100 stickers left.

According to the information, the amount he received for the sale of his most recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[ 44000 = 5x - 1000 \]

We need to solve for \( x \) to find out how much he made on his previous painting.

Let's denote the length of the orange car as \( L \).

First, we know that the length of the red bus is four times the length of the orange car:
\[ \text{Length of red bus} = 4L \]

Given that the bus is 48 feet long, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4L = 48 \]

Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ feet} \]

So the length of the orange car is 12 feet.

Next, we know that the length of the orange car is 3.5 times shorter than the length of the yellow bus:

✓ GROUND TRUTH: After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 miles.
Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 miles.
Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = <<8-7=1>>1 mile apart when the second runner stops.
Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile.

Now, if $1600 has to be returned, we subtract this from the total:

$28,000 - $1600 = $26,400

Therefore, the sky diving company has taken $26,400 altogether.

Let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the stand makes in one hour. 

   Each hot dog sells for $2, and there are 10 hot dogs sold every hour.

   So, in one hour, the stand makes 2 * 10 = $20.

2. Now we need to find out how many hours it will take for the stand to make $200.

   We know the stand makes $20 in one hour. So, we need to divide $200 by $20 per hour:

   $200 / $20 per hour = 10 hours.

So, the stand needs to run for 10 hours to ma...

In the second week, she knitted 12 + 4 = 16 pairs.
In the third week, she knitted half of the total of the first two weeks, so 12 + 16 = 28 pairs, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

First, we need to determine how much Maya can currently lift. America can lift 240 pounds and Maya can lift a fourth of that, which is 240 / 4 = 60 pounds. Maya grows stronger and adds 10 more pounds, so her current lift is 60 + 10 = 70 pounds.
Next, America hits her peak lift of 300 pounds. If Maya reaches her absolute peak at half of America's peak, then Maya can lift 300 / 2 = 150 pounds.
To find out how many more pounds Maya can lift now than when she started, we subtract what she co...

First, let's determine how much Maya can lift initially. She can lift a fourth of America's initial lift of 240 pounds.

240 / 4 = 60 pounds

So, Maya can lift 60 pounds initially.

Next, we need to calculate how much Maya can lift after her growth. America's lift peaks at 300 pounds, and Maya follows this pattern by adding 10 pounds to her lift after each growth period. After each growth period, Maya can lift her previous peak lift.

Let's assume Maya reached her peak after \( n \) grow...

Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected 2*(2x) = 4x erasers.

The total number of erasers collected by all three is 35:
x (Gabriel) + 2x (Celine) + 4x (Julian) = 35.

Barney can perform 45 sit-ups per minute.
Carrie can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney, so 45 * 2 = 90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, so 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per minute.

Barney does sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does 45 sit-ups.
Carrie does sit-ups for 2 minutes, so she does 90 * 2 = 180 sit-ups.
Jerrie does sit-ups for 3 minutes, so she does 95 * 3 = 285 sit-ups.

Combined total = Barney's sit-ups + Carrie's sit-ups + Jerrie's sit-ups....

✓ GROUND TRUTH: Carrie can do 2*45=<<2*45=90>>90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 90+5=<<90+5=95>>95 sit-ups per minute.
In two minutes, Carrie would perform 90*2-180 sit-ups.
And in three minutes, Jerrie would perform 3 * 95=<<3*95=285>>285 sit-ups.
Thus, in the scenario described, in total, the three would perform 45+180+285=<<45+180+285=510>>510 sit-ups.

The stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour.

To make $200, the total sales from hot dogs must equal $200.
First, we need to find out how much money is made from selling one hot dog.
Money per hot dog = $2
Total sales = $200
Total number of hot dogs needed = Total sales / Money per hot dog
Total number of hot dogs needed = $200 / $2

Porter received $44,000 for his most recent painting.
Let's denote the amount he made for his previous painting as \( x \).
According to the problem, the sale of his most recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than his previous painting.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 5x - 1000 = 44000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 5x = 44000 + 1000 \]
\[ 5x = 45000 \]
\[ x = 45000 / 5 \]
\[ x = 9000 \]

Therefore, Porter made $9000 for selling his previous painting.

First, we need to determine how many servings are in one bottle of spirits. The problem states that a bottle has 16 servings.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue made by the restaurant from selling all the servings in the bottle. The restaurant charges $8.00 per serving, so we multiply the number of servings by the price per serving:

16 servings * $8.00/serving = $128.00

Now we need to subtract the cost of the bottle from the total revenue to find out how much money the resta...

According to the problem, half of the total berries were raspberries, so \( \frac{T}{2} = \frac{42}{2} = 21 \) raspberries.

A third of the total berries were blackberries, so \( \frac{T}{3} = \frac{42}{3} = 14 \) blackberries.

Now, we need to find out how many blueberries there were. We know that the total number of berries is the sum of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. So, we can write:

The total cost of the bottle is $30.00.
The bottle has 16 servings.
The price per serving is $8.00.
The total revenue from selling the bottle is the cost of the bottle multiplied by the price per serving, which is $30.00 * $8.00 = $240.00.
The revenue from the bottle is $240.00.
The cost of the bottle is $30.00.
The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is $240.00 - $30.00 = $210.00.

In five years, Sam's age will be \( S + 5 \) and Drew's age will be \( D + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 \).

According to the problem, in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + 5 = 3 \times (17) \]

Now we solve for \( S \):
\[ S + 5 = 51 \]
\[ S = 51 - 5 \]
\[ S = 46 \]

So, Sam is currently 46 years...

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Drew's current age as \( D \).
We know that \( D = 12 \) years.

In five years, Drew's age will be \( D + 5 \).
In five years, Sam's age will be \( S + 5 \).

According to the problem, in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew, so we can set up the equation:
\( S + 5 = 3(D + 5) \).

Substituting \( D = 12 \) into the equation:
\( S + 5 = 3(12 + 5) \)
\( S + 5 = 3(17) \)
\( S + 5 = 51 \).

Now, to find \( S \), we subtract 5 from both ...

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as \( x \).

According to the problem, the sale of his most recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 44000 = 5x + 1000 - x \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 44000 = 5x + 1000 - x \]
\[ 44000 = 4x + 1000 \]
\[ 44000 - 1000 = 4x \]
\[ 43000 = 4x \]

📝 FULL MODEL OUTPUT:
Think:
Let's denote the cost of one Lego set as \( x \).

George sold 3 little cars and a set of Legos. We know one little car was sold for $5.

So, the total earnings from the little cars is \( 3 \times \$5 \).

Therefore, the equation representing the total earnings is:
\[ 3 \times 5 + x = 45 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 15 + x = 45 \]
\[ x = 45 - 15 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The cost of the Legos set is $30.

Answer: The Legos set cost $30.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: The total cost of food that the cow ate for the forty days is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
To feed and maintain the health of the cow, the total expenses Jett used is $500+$800 = $<<500+800=1300>>1300
With the expenses, Jett used $1300+$600 = $<<1300+600=1900>>1900 on the cow.
If he sold the cow at $2500, Jett made a profit of $2500-$1900 = $<<2500-1900=600>>600

📝 FULL MODEL OUTPUT:
Think: To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and subtract it from the selling price. 
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of feeding the cow daily. 
$20/day x 40 days = $800
Step 2: Add the cost of vaccination and deworming. 
$800 + $500 = $1300
Step 3: Add the initial cost of the cow. 
$1300 + $600 = $1900
Step 4: Subtract the selling price from the total cost to find the profit. 
$2500 - $1900 = $600

Answer: Jett made a profit of $600.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Drew's current age as \( D \). We are given that \( D = 12 \) years.

In five years, Sam will be \( S + 5 \) years old, and Drew will be \( D + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 \) years old.

According to the problem, in five years, Sam will be three times as old as Drew:

\[ S + 5 = 3 \times (D + 5) \]

Substituting \( D = 12 \) into the equation:

\[ S + 5 = 3 \times (12 + 5) \]

\[ S + 5 = 3 \times 17 \]

\[ S + 5 = 51 \]

Let's denote the cost of one pair of jeans as \( x \). Then we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 70 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So each pair of jeans cost $20.

To find out how much money James has left, we need to follow each step of his spending and saving process.
1. James earns $10 per week, so after saving for four weeks he has 4 * $10 = $40.
2. He spends half of his savings on a video game, which costs 0.5 * $40 = $20.
3. After buying the video game, James has $40 - $20 = $20 left.
4. He then spends a quarter of the remaining money on a book, which costs 0.25 * $20 = $5.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 swallows.
2. According to the problem, there are half as many swallows as bluebirds. So, if there are 2 swallows, there would be:

\[ 2 \text{ swallows} \times 2 = 4 \text{ bluebirds} \]

3. The problem also states that there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds. If there are 4 bluebirds, there would be:

\[ 4 \text{ bluebirds} \times 3 = 12 \text{ cardinals} \]

4. Now we need to add up all the birds:

1. On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.
2. On Friday, they sold twice that amount, so 2 * 210 = 420 pounds.
3. On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.
4. To find the average, we need to add up the total pounds and divide by the number of days.
5. Total pounds sold = 210 (Thursday) + 420 (Friday) + 150 (Saturday) = 780 pounds.
6. Number of days = 3 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday).

The rock's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 3 times 1/2 equals <<3*1/2=1.5>>1.5.
The boulder's total splash width is 4 because 2 times 2 equals four.
The total splash width for all the rocks is 7 because 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 4 equals 7.

\( 44,000 = 5x - 1,000 \).

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by adding 1,000 to both sides of the equation:

\( 44,000 + 1,000 = 5x - 1,000 + 1,000 \)

\( 45,000 = 5x \).

So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.
Therefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = <<121-100=21>>21 meters.

Let's break down the problem. The tree grows 10% more each year, meaning it doubles its height each year because 100 * 1.1 = 110. The tree grows from 2017 to the end of 2019, which is 3 years. We should calculate the final height at the end of 2019 and then subtract the height at the beginning of 2017 to find out how much it has grown.

Let's denote the number of erasers Gabriel collected as G.
According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, so Celine collected 2G erasers.
Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected 2 * 2G = 4G erasers.
The total number of erasers collected by all three is 35, so we can write the equation: G + 2G + 4G = 35.
Simplifying the equation: 7G = 35.
Dividing both sides by 7: G = 5.
Therefore, Celine collected 2 * 5 = 10 erasers.

Let G be the number of erasers Gabriel collected.
Celine collected twice as many as Gabriel, so C = 2G.
Julian collected twice as many as Celine, so J = 2C = 2(2G) = 4G.
Together they collected 35 erasers: G + C + J = 35.
Substituting the expressions for C and J into the equation, we get G + 2G + 4G = 35.
Combining like terms, we get 7G = 35.
Dividing both sides by 7, we get G = 5.
Therefore, Celine collected 2G = 2(5) = 10 erasers.

Let's denote the length of the orange car as \( x \).
So the length of the yellow bus would then be \( 3.5 \times x \).
We know the length of the red bus is four times the length of the orange car.
So the length of the red bus is \( 4x \).
We are told that the red bus is 48 feet long, so \( 4x = 48 \).
Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \) feet.
So the length of the orange car is 12 feet.
The length of the yellow bus is therefore \( 3.5 \times 12 = 42 \) feet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know the length of the yellow bus (Y) is equal to the length of the red bus (R) * 3.5.
2. We are given that the red bus is 48 feet long, so Y = R * 3.5.
3. We also know that the red bus is 4 times the length of the orange car (C). Thus, R = 4 * C.
4. From this, we can find the length of the orange car by dividing the length of the red bus by 4: C = R / 4.
5. To find the length of the yellow bus, we can use the relationship Y = R * 3.5.

Let's break down the information given:
- Total berries: 42
- Half of all berries were raspberries
- A third of all berries were blackberries

First, we need to find how many berries were raspberries, which are half of the total berries.
Also, we know that a third of the berries are blackberries, so we can find the number of blackberries this way.
Finally, we can subtract the number of raspberries and blackberries from the total to find the number of blueberries.

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Pauly has. Since there are three dozen eggs, we calculate this as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
Next, we need to find out how many omelets Pauly can make with 36 eggs, given that each omelet requires 4 eggs. We calculate this as 36 / 4 = 9 omelets.
Finally, we need to divide the total number of omelets by the number of people to find out how many omelets each person gets. We calculate this as 9 / 3 = 3 omelets per person.

Don throws 3 darts. 
The first dart is a bullseye worth 50 points.
The second dart completely missed the target, so received no points.
The third dart is worth half the points of the bullseye, which is 50/2 = 25 points.
To find the final score, we add up the points from all three throws: 50 + 0 + 25 = 75 points.

He wants to buy 5 video-games, so he needs at least:

That leaves him with $525 - $225 = $300 in profit.

He wants to buy as many books as possible with this amount. The books cost $5 each, so the number of books he can buy is:

Next, add up the total amount of meat he bought. The total amount is 20 + 10 = 30 pounds of meat.
Then, divide the total amount of meat by the amount used for each meal. That gives us 30 / 1.5 = 20 meals.

First, we need to calculate how many matches Sam won in his first 100 matches. Since he won 50% of his first 100 matches, we can calculate this by multiplying 100 by 50% or 0.5.

100 * 0.5 = 50 matches won in the first 100 matches.

Next, we calculate how many matches Sam won in his next 100 games. Since he won 60% of his next 100 matches, we can calculate this by multiplying 100 by 60% or 0.6.

100 * 0.6 = 60 matches won in the next 100 matches.

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Pauly has. Since there are three dozen eggs, we calculate this as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
Next, we need to find out how many omelets Pauly can make with 36 eggs, given that each omelet requires 4 eggs. We calculate this as 36 / 4 = 9 omelets.
Finally, we need to divide the total number of omelets by the number of people, which is 3. We calculate this as 9 / 3 = 3 omelets per person.

First, we need to find out how many times Camden and Susannah went swimming per week.  
Camden went swimming 16 times in March, which is approximately 4 weeks.  
Susannah went swimming 24 times in March, which is also approximately 4 weeks.  
So, Camden went swimming 16 / 4 = 4 times per week.  
And Susannah went swimming 24 / 4 = 6 times per week.  
Now we find the difference: 6 - 4 = 2 times per week.

First, let's find out how many times Camden and Susannah went swimming in a week by dividing their total number of swims by 4 weeks.

For Camden: 
\( \frac{16\, times}{4\, weeks} = 4\, times\, per\, week \)

For Susannah:
\( \frac{24\, times}{4\, weeks} = 6\, times\, per\, week \)

Now we can find the difference in the number of times they went swimming per week: 
\( 6 - 4 = 2 \)

Susannah went 2 more times per week than Camden.

Let's denote the amount he made from his previous painting as x dollars.
The mural he painted this time was sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting, which can be expressed as: 5x - 1000.
We are told that he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting, so we can set up the equation: 5x - 1000 = 44000.
To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

To calculate profit, you need to first find the total revenue from selling the woodburning and then subtract the cost of the wood.
Total revenue = Number of woodburning * Price per item
Total revenue = 20 * $15
Total revenue = $300

Total cost = Cost of wood
Total cost = $100

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $300 - $100
Profit = $200

Let's denote the number of erasers Gabriel collected as G. According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, so Celine collected 2G erasers. Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected 2(2G) = 4G erasers.

The total number of erasers collected by Celine, Gabriel, and Julian is 35. So, we can write the equation:

G + 2G + 4G = 35

Combining like terms, we get:

7G = 35

Now, we can solve for G:
G = 35 / 7
G = 5

So, Gabriel collected 5 ...

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Pauly has. Since there are three dozen eggs, we multiply 3 by 12, which gives us 36 eggs.
Next, we need to determine how many omelets Pauly can make with 36 eggs, given that each omelet requires 4 eggs. We divide 36 by 4, which gives us 9 omelets.
Now, we need to distribute these 9 omelets among the 3 people. We divide 9 by 3, which gives us 3 omelets per person.

George sold 3 little cars and a set of Legos.
Each little car was sold for $5, so the total earnings from the cars is 3 * $5 = $15.
He earned a total of $45 from selling his toys.
To find out how much the Legos set cost, we subtract the total earnings from cars from the total earnings: $45 - $15 = $30.
So, the Legos set cost $30.

Let's break down the problem. We know that George sold 3 little cars at $5 each and earned a total of $45. The Legos set is what we're trying to find the cost of.

First, we will calculate the total earnings from the little cars:
3 cars * $5/car = $15

Now, we need to subtract the earnings from the cars from the total earnings to find the cost of the Legos set:
$45 - $15 (cars) = $30

First, we need to determine the total number of slices from both pizzas:
- The small cheese pizza has 8 slices.
- The large pepperoni pizza has 14 slices.
- The total number of slices is 8 + 14 = 22 slices.

Next, we calculate how many slices have been eaten by both of them:
- Each of them has eaten 9 slices.
- So, together they have eaten 9 + 9 = 18 slices.

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:

The total number of erasers collected is 35, so we can write the equation: G + 2G + 4G = 35.
Combining like terms, we get 7G = 35.

First, let's find the height of each stack:
- The first stack is 7 blocks tall.
- The second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first, so it is 7 + 3 = 10 blocks tall.
- The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second, so it is 10 - 6 = 4 blocks tall.
- The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third, so it is 4 + 10 = 14 blocks tall.

Barney can perform 45 sit-ups in one minute.
Carrie can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney can, so Carrie can do 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie can do, so Jerrie can do 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per minute.
Barney does sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does 45 sit-ups.
Carrie does sit-ups for 2 minutes, so she does 2 * 90 = 180 sit-ups.

✓ GROUND TRUTH: Carrie can do 2*45=<<2*45=90>>90 sit-ups per minute.
Jerrie can do 90+5=<<90+5=95>>95 sit-ups per minute.
In two minutes, Carrie would perform 90*2-180 sit-ups.
And in three minutes, Jerrie would perform 3 * 95=<<3*95=285>>285 sit-ups.
Thus, in the scenario described, in total, the three would perform 45+180+285=<<45+180+285=510>>510 sit-ups.

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the sale of the recent painting is $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. So, we can write the equation: 
\[ x + 1000 = 5x \]

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of \( x \).
\[ 1000 = 5x - x \]
\[ 1000 = 4x \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, Porter made $250 for his previous painting.

Let's denote the number of cats as C.
Frankie has 6 more snakes than cats, so the number of snakes is C + 6.
He has one less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is C - 1.
He has 2 dogs.
Six of his pets have four legs, which means he has 6 pets with four legs.
The total number of pets is the sum of all the pets: C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) + 2 (dogs) = 6.

Then, to find the other teammate's points we perform 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 points scored, as they scored 6 times as many as Righty did.
We then add all three teammates' points together, performing 20+10+60=<<20+10+60=90>>90 points as the first step towards finding the average.
We then divide this sum by the total number of players we're averaging, getting 90/3=<<90/3=30>>30 points per player

For the second part, each box holds 8 containers of oil, so 200 * 8 = 1600 containers of oil.

For the third part, we divide the total number of containers by the number of trucks after redistribution. So 1600 / 10 = 160 containers of oil per truck.  ✗ INCORRECT

We first need to calculate the total number of boxes, which is the sum of the boxes in the trucks given the information. We'll then calculate the total amount of oil in containers. Finally, we'll divide the total oil containers by the number of trucks after redistribution to find out how many each truck will have.

Let's denote the number of bluebirds as B. According to the problem, there are half as many swallows as bluebirds, and since there are 2 swallows, we can set up the equation:
2 = B / 2

Now, we can solve for B:
B = 2 * 2
B = 4

So, there are 4 bluebirds.

Now we know there are 4 bluebirds. According to the problem, there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds. So we can set up the equation:

First, we need to find the total amount of ground beef sold over the three days. On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds. On Friday, they sold twice that amount, which is 2 * 210 = 420 pounds. On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.

To find the total, we add up the amounts sold each day:
210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds

Now, to find the average, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 3:
780 / 3 = 260 pounds per day

Let's denote Sam's current age as S and Drew's current age as D.
Drew's current age is given as 12.
In five years, Drew will be D + 5.
In five years, Sam will be 3 times Drew's age, which is 3(D + 5).

So, S + 5 = 3(D + 5).

Substitute D = 12 into the equation:

S + 5 = 3(12 + 5)
S + 5 = 3(17)

Let's denote Sam's current age as S and Drew's current age as D.
We know that Drew's current age is 12 years.
In five years, Sam's age will be S + 5 and Drew's age will be D + 5.

According to the problem, in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew. So, we can write the equation:

S + 5 = 3(D + 5)

We know that D = 12, so we can substitute this into our equation:

S + 5 = 3(12 + 5)
S + 5 = 3(17)
S + 5 = 51

Ezekiel's total hike distance is 50 kilometers.
On the first day, he hiked 10 kilometers.
On the second day, he hiked half the full hike distance, which is 50/2 = 25 kilometers.
To find out how many kilometers he had to hike on the third day, we subtract the distance he hiked on the first and second days from the total distance.
50 - 10 - 25 = 15 kilometers.

Let's denote the number of erasers Gabriel collected as G. According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, so Celine collected 2G erasers. Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Juliano collected 2 * 2G = 4G erasers. Together, they collected 35 erasers, so we can write the equation:
G + 2G + 4G = 35

Combining like terms, we get:
7G = 35

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
G = 5

Now, we can find the number of erasers Celine collected:
2G = 2 * 5...

Let's denote the amount Porter made from his previous painting as x dollars.

According to the problem, the most recent painting sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting. So, we can write this as:
Recent sale amount = 5x - 1000

We also know that he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting. So we can set up the equation:
Recent sale amount = $44,000

Now we can solve for x:
5x - 1000 = $44,000

Add 1000 to both sides:
5x = $45,00...

📝 FULL MODEL OUTPUT:
To calculate the profit Jett made from selling the cow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost Jett incurred.
2. Subtract the total cost from the selling price of the cow to get the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost Jett incurred.

- Cost of food: $20 per day for 40 days = $20 * 40 = $800
- Cost of vaccination and deworming: $500
- Cost of the cow: $600

Total cost = Cost of food + Cost of vaccination and deworming + Cost of the cow
Total cost = $800 + $500 + $600 = ...

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Olaf initially has 150 toy cars.
2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Let's denote the number of toy cars the uncle gave as \( U \). Therefore, Grandpa gave \( 2U \) toy cars.
3. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.
4. Mum gave Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so Mum gave \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) toy cars.
5. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, which is 1 more than the uncle. So, the uncle gave \( 6 - 1 = 5 \) toy cars.

James earns $10 per week, so over four weeks, he earns $10 * 4 = $40.
He spends half of it on a new video game, so he spends $40 / 2 = $20 on the video game.
After buying the video game, he has $40 - $20 = $20 left.
He then spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book, so he spends $20 / 4 = $5 on the book.
After buying the book, he has $20 - $5 = $15 left.

Therefore, James has $15 left.

- On Thursday, Walmart sold 210 pounds.
- On Friday, Walmart sold twice the amount of Thursday, which is 2 * 210 = 420 pounds.
- On Saturday, Walmart sold 150 pounds.
Total pounds sold = 210 + 420 + 150 = 780 pounds.

To calculate the total sit-ups performed by each individual, we need to first determine their individual sit-up rates, then multiply these rates by the number of minutes each spends performing sit-ups. Barney can do 45 sit-ups per minute. Carrie can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney, so she can do 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups per minute. Jerrie does 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie, so she can do 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups per minute.

Now, we calculate the total number of sit-ups each ...

1. Start by figuring out how much Maya could lift initially: 
Maya can lift a fourth of what America can lift, and America can lift 240 pounds initially.
So, initially, Maya can lift \( \frac{240}{4} = 60 \) pounds.
2. Now, determine how many pounds Maya can add each time she grows stronger: 
Mentioned that every time Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift.
3. Calculate how much Maya can lift at her peak: 
America has reached her peak lift at 30...

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we determine how many sit-ups Barney can do in one minute: 45 sit-ups.

2. Carrie can do twice as many sit-ups per minute as Barney does: 2 * 45 = 90 sit-ups.

3. Jerrie can do 5 more sit-ups per minute than Carrie does: 90 + 5 = 95 sit-ups.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of sit-ups each person does:

   - Barney does sit-ups for 1 minute, so he does 45 sit-ups.
   - Carrie does sit-ups for 2 minutes, so she does 90 * 2 = 180 sit-ups.

At the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10/100 = <<110*10/100=11>>11 meters more.
So, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.

At the end of 2017, the tree was 100 meters tall.
It grows 10% more than its previous height each year.
To calculate the growth from 2017 to 2019, we need to calculate the height for each year step by step.
First, calculate height at the end of 2018:
100 * 1.10 = 110 meters
Then, calculate height at the end of 2019:
110 * 1.10 = 121 meters

Let's denote the number of erasers Gabriel collected as \( G \).

According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, so Celine collected \( 2G \) erasers.

Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected \( 2 \times 2G = 4G \) erasers.

The total number of erasers collected by all three is 35, so we can write the equation:

\[ G + 2G + 4G = 35 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 7G = 35 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ G = 5 \]

Emma starts with $100 in her account.
Each day, she spends $8.
In a week, she spends $8 x 7 = $56.
So, after a week, she has $100 - $56 = $44 left in her account.
At the end of the week, she asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her.
So, she can get $44 / $5 = 8 $5 bills.
Therefore, she leaves the rest in the account, which is $44 - $40 = $4.

2. Then as Maya gets stronger, she adds 10 more pounds, bringing her lift to:
   60 + 10 = 70 pounds.

3. When America reaches her peak lift at 300 pounds, Maya can lift half of it:
   300 / 2 = 150 pounds.

For the first 100 matches, Sam won 50%. Thus, he won 50 * 100 = 50 matches. In the next 100 matches, he won 60% of his games. We can find the number of matches he won in the final 100 matches by multiplying the total number of matches by the percentage he won in those matches, so 60 * 100 = 60 matches. In total, he won 50 + 60 = 110 matches.

The stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour. Each hot dog is sold for $2.

To find out how many hours the stand needs to run to make $200 in sales, we first find out the total revenue per hour. The revenue per hour is the number of hot dogs sold per hour multiplied by the price per hot dog:

10 hot dogs/hour * $2/hot dog = $20/hour

Now, to find out the total number of hours required to make $200, we divide the total sales goal by the revenue per hour:

$200 / $20/hour = 10 hours

So the selling price of one birdhouse is $10.50 + $5.50 = $<<10.5+5.5=16>>16.
Thus, Denver will charge Danny $16 x 2 = $<<16*2=32>>32 for the two birdhouses.

First, we need to determine the cost of wood for one birdhouse.
Cost of wood per birdhouse = 7 pieces * $1.50 per piece = $10.50

Next, we calculate the profit per birdhouse, which is given as $5.50.

Then, we add the cost of the wood to the profit to get the total price per birdhouse.
Total price per birdhouse = Cost of wood + Profit = $10.50 + $5.50 = $16.00

Since Danny is buying two birdhouses, we multiply the total price per birdhouse by 2.
Total price for two birdhouses = Total pri...

First, calculate the total weight of the water in the bathtub.
1 cubic foot of water is 7.5 gallons.
6 cubic feet of water would be 6 * 7.5 gallons = 45 gallons.
Each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.
45 gallons of water would weigh 45 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon = 360 pounds.
Next, calculate the amount of jello mix needed.
For every pound of water, you need 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix.
So for 360 pounds of water, you need 360 pounds * 1.5 tablespoons/pound = 540 tablespoons of jello mix.

First, we need to calculate the total spent by Jett on the cow. We do this by adding the cost of food, vaccination, and deworming.

Food cost: $20/day * 40 days = $800
Vaccination and deworming: $500

Total spent: $800 (food) + $500 (vaccination and deworming) = $1300

Now, we need to subtract the total spent from the selling price to find out the profit.

Profit: $2500 (selling price) - $1300 (total spent) = $1200

We can approach this step-by-step:

1. First, we start with 250 books.
2. On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out, decreasing the total by 120.
   250 - 120 = 130 books remain.
3. On Wednesday, 35 books are returned, increasing the total by 35.
   130 + 35 = 165 books now.
4. On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn, decreasing the total by 15.
   165 - 15 = 150 books now.

Therefore, after these transactions, there are 150 books in the library.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money taken by the company before any cancellations.
Total money taken = Individual bookings + Group bookings
Total money taken = $12,000 + $16,000

Next, we subtract the $1600 that was returned to customers.
Total money taken after cancellations = Total money taken - Cancellations
Total money taken after cancellations = ($12,000 + $16,000) - $1600

Now, let's perform the calculations.
Total money taken after cancellations = $28,000 - $1,60...

✓ GROUND TRUTH: After 56 minutes, the second runner has traveled 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 miles.
Similarly, the first runner has traveled 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 miles.
Therefore, the two runners are 8 - 7 = <<8-7=1>>1 mile apart when the second runner stops.
Thus, the second runner can stop for a maximum of 8 minutes, which is the amount of time it takes the first runner to travel 1 mile.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The race is 10 miles long.
2. The first runner completes the race in 8 minutes per mile, so for 10 miles, it takes \(10 \times 8 = 80\) minutes.
3. The second runner completes the race in 7 minutes per mile, so for 10 miles, it takes \(10 \times 7 = 70\) minutes.
4. After 56 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water.
5. The first runner starts running after the second runner has stopped.
6. The first runner has been running for 5...

Let's first calculate how long it takes each runner to complete a mile at their respective paces.
1. The first runner runs at a pace of 8 minutes per mile.
2. The second runner runs at a pace of 7 minutes per mile.

Now, we know that the first runner is faster than the second runner, which means the first runner will always be catching up to the second runner.

Let's calculate the distance each runner has covered in 56 minutes.
For the first runner:
56 minutes * 8 minutes per mile = 448 ...
